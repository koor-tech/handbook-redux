# Weekly employee-manager 1-on-1 meetings

## Purpose

Of the many good reasons to have 1-on-1s, we will focus on three.

First, one-on-ones are a time to reflect on recent accomplishments and to realign on the next set of challenges. They are also a good time to discuss work matters of a more individual or personal nature: career aspirations, performance feedback, general well-being, etc.

Second, one-on-ones provide an opportunity to chronicle the work you are doing as it is happening. It's a lot easier to remember what you have done with a weekly journal of what you have done.

Third, one-on-ones give you and your manager a chance to build your working relationship, to develop trust, and to help each other make better contributions to the company.


## General procedure

As a standard practice, each employee will meet with his or her manager on a weekly basis. The meeting will block a half-hour slot in the calendar. While it is fine to make full use of the time, the meeting can end once all of the topics are covered.

The calendar invite will include the recurring Meet or Zoom meeting and a shared Google document for 1-1 notes.

The employee can make this easier by preparing for the meeting. Before the meeting starts, open the shared notes and create a new heading with the meeting date. Copy the template, and answer the questions. It is okay to summarize, or add as much detail as needed to be clear.

When your notes are ready, you can @ notify your manager in the document. Giving your manager time to read the notes beforehand will either speed up the meeting or allow you to discuss matters more deeply. Also, it gives you time to remember additional points.

During the meeting, have the notes open and additional thoughts that come up.
