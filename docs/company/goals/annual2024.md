# 2024 Annual Goals

## 1. Grow annual revenue to $1MM

- Do this to have a chance to get Series A funding.
- The sooner the better.

## 2. Aquire 100 new customers, including 10 enterprise customers

- Build social proof that our offering is trusted and popular.
- Demonstrate ability to handle operations at scale and to work with large customers.

# 2024 Q1 Goals

Near-term goals based on our new strategy that support our annual goals.

## 1. Offer Ceph managed services instead of Data Control Center

- Koor sets up and operates Ceph storage on behalf of customers who want to outsource data storage.
- Revise website, Stripe, and contracts to promote this offering and make it easy to purchase.
- Create a priority list of things to automate: provisioning, monitoring, notifications, etc.
- Run awareness campaign to tell the world about it.
- Feature additional services to see what interests customer.
  - Encryption
  - Adopt a Cluster - for when a customer wants to take it over and operate it themselves.
  - Compliance - someday
  - Migration - on / off

## 2. Sell $100,000 in managed storage

- Say we offer 5-node clusters as a base at $50/node/year and discount 2 months for a 1-year commitment, that would be $2,500 per sale.
- If we sell 40 of those, that's a way to reach our goal.

## 3. Acquire 1 enterprise-scale customer (50+ nodes)

- We need to attract at least one larger company to place on our marquee.
- This is orthoganal to the revenue goal.
