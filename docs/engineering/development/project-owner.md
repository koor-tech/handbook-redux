# Project Owner Role

## Motivation

Koor will always have at least a few active projects. We have products to develop and customers to care for, plus on-going improvements to our internal systems and operations. For certain, we need to work as a group. Collaboration is the best way to get things done.

However, no group is good at leading itself. In polite company, everyone defers to everyone else for decisions. Differences of opinion are tricky to resolve productively. People tend to defer to whoever in the discussion has the most "power" or "authority."

Also, it is a rare skill to look for the things that are not being done and that are essential to making progress. The result is that a project drags on without us realizing why we are not finishing. At that point, an individual might roll up sleeves, work "through the night" or for "days on end," and just get it done. While that's admirable (and happens in a start-up), it is also an anti-pattern.

The antidote is to establish a project owner for each active project.

## What is a project owner?

The **project owner** is kind of like a project manager, except with a key difference. A **project manager** tends to be someone who stands around with a clipboard asking people for their status. The project owner is accountable for getting things to happen usually by completing a lot of the work. The project owner should solicit help from others, too. Other could be part of the project team, dedicating a non-trivial portion of their time to the work. A project may also need just a bit of someone's time.

Here are some statements that help define a project owner.

The project owner:

- Decides what needs to be done
  - Perhaps in collaboration with a **product owner** - someone who defines what a product should do
- Prioritizes improvement items,
- Organizes items into milestones,
- Coordinates with others to finish work items,
- Updates Linear every week,
- Reports on and demonstrates progress every week
- Drives to finish the project, at least to the next milestone
  - At that point, we might decide to another project or keep going to the next milestone
  - We could also switch project owners, ideally once we get closure by reaching the next milestone

The owner does not have to do all of the work. Everyone is responsible for picking up items from any project they are helping with. People should update Linear for the parts they work on. People should demonstrate sub-systems that they build.

## Initial assignments

To get things started, here is a proposal.
