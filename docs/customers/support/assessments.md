# System assessments

Every customer who purchases KSD Pro is entitled to a system assessment. We will spend about 5 hours to understand their operations and provide a detailed assessment of how things are running, where bottlenecks are, and options of how to address issues.

If a system is sufficiently large, our assessment results may be incomplete in the time allotted. In such cases, let's provide a higher level assessment using the 5 hours we have.

If customers choose to engage Koor to correct issues from the assessment, they may need to purchase additional consulting hours.

These are the things to check and report on in a system assessment.

*TODO: Alex and team, please change this to match what we actually check*

1. health check of Rook Ceph processes
2. storage capacity
3. maintenance routines

The system assessment report looks like this:

*TODO - add an example*

**Important: To ensure high quality and consistency, the Engagement Manager must review all system assessments before they are delivered to the customer.**
