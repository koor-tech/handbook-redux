# Company Holidays

Koor is an international company with people from many different countries and backgrounds. Our company holiday policy reflects this reality.

The one common set of days off is centered on the Christmas and New Year's holidays, for a total of 4 weekday holidays. In addition, individual should follow their own national and religious holidays. The guideline is to take 10 days off in total per year for such official paid holidays. That means 6 holidays are at the employee's discretion for this purpose. Please coordinate with your manager.

Holidays do not accumulate. Take time off as they happen. If you end up working during a holiday (for instance, if you have to help resolve a customer emergency), you should make-up the missed time off as soon as feasible. Your manager will help to accomodate your situation.
