# Release Checklist

For each release, copy these steps into a new Linear issue. Convert bullets to checkboxes. Then assign out the tasks. Check off tasks as you finish them.

If something is missing from the checklist, add it both to the issue. Also, create a Linear issue to add the item to this template. That way it won't block you, and we won't forget to improve this template for the future.
