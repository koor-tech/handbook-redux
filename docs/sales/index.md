# Sales

The only way Koor will stay in business is to generate enough revenue to cover our costs and fuel our growth. That's what sales is all about.

Our sales strategy is simple. Offer customers help with their self-managed data storage. That help comes in two forms: our software that makes it easier to set up and operate Rook Ceph data storage, and support from storage experts.

Both kinds of support are available for free, allowing prospective customers to sample our wares. Anyone can register for a free, unlimited-time trial of Koor Data Control Center for up to 4 storage nodes. Also, we answer questions that people send us. Our knowledge base is also freely available and full of good advice.

Ultimately, sales is about finding customers in need of help and showing them how Koor can be their partner in running their data storage.

## Targets

Our sales targets are tied to the survival of Koor. What is outlined here is the minimum needed to keep going. On the upside, the sky is the limit, so to speak, so sell as much as possible. After that, we can think about going into orbit.

### Entry scale

Anyone who purchases up to 10 license for Koor Pro Bundle is considered an entry-level customer. The size is really a measure of their data storage than their enterprise. For instance, this could be for a small company that manages a modest Ceph cluster, or it might be for a larger organization that uses Ceph as one of its data solutions.

### Enterprise scale

Any storage cluster larger than 10 nodes should be considered enterprise scale.

At the lower end of the range, we can work out per-node discounts and identify appropriate levels of support. Medium scale enterprise is 10 to 100 nodes. This is something Koor can take on at any time. Anything beyond 100 nodes is consider large scale enterprise.

Ceph can scale to petabytes (PB) of storage, which would run on thousands of storage nodes. Organizations with this amount of storage might need dedicated 24/7 emergency support, system design expertise, and on-going maintenance. Some will need help training their employees on the particulars of Ceph and running at massive scale. While this would be new for Koor, this is exactly the kind of challenge we need to master.

### Milestones

Stated targets must be attained by the milestone date. More is better, and we will add future targets as we go. Missing any target will be cause for soul searching.
