# Koor's Consulting Practice

A majority of Koor's revenue potential hinges on offering professional services, a.k.a. consulting, to customers who are having issues with their Rook/Ceph data storage. While we intend for the balance of revenue to shift towards renewal software subscriptions, a key part of the business will always involve helping those who are stuck.

This section of the handbook describes how we take care of customers with consulting engagements.

## Operations

Koor has a weekly routine for staying on top of customer engagement. 

*TODO Let's decide on the right actions to take on a weekly basis. What you see below is a starting point that needs improvement.*

1. At the start of each week:
   1. The Engagement Manager reviews each consulting engagement and asks questions to understand how things are going and what is left to do.
   2. Team members reflect on their consulting work from the previous week and updates a to-do list for the current week.
   3. Any new customers (KDS Pro subscribers) must be contacted to schedule a discovery call. The Engagement Manager assigns an Engagement Lead for each new customer.
   4. Review the [tracking spreadsheet](tracking) to ensure that hours for the previous week are accurately noted.
2. At the end of each week:
   1. Each team member updates the [tracking spreadsheet](tracking) to record hours spent on consulting. Remember to record "non-billable" hours as well.
   2. Write a summary of next steps for each active engagement.
