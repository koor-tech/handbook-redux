# Tracking hours

Consulting engagements are paid by the hour. Customers acquire blocks of time. We want to be sure we are giving customers what they have paid for, and we want to get paid for the work we do. Therefore, we need to track how much time we spend with each customer working on their systems.

Hours are tracked on a daily basis in [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fl_ocrEXpOHbSKW155eugh7iNBTVqG2Kro4xHU_22xU/edit?usp=sharing). We will aggregate hours each month and reconcile balances. Invoices are sent at that time for any payments that are due.

Be sure to include hours spent diagnosing, discussing, and solving problems with their data storage. The following activities should be included:

1. meetings to understand the problems from the customer's point of view
2. systems analysis
3. troubleshooting specific issues
4. identifying bottlenecks
5. writing reports of findings
6. discussing our findings and recommending solutions
7. system design

We do not want to overcharge. It is better to impress customers by exceeding expectations. The following may be tracked for internal purposes and will not count against the hours purchased.

1. training Koor employees (shadowing those who are leading the engagement)
2. answering Help Desk questions - these should be generic in nature and not involve a big time commitment
3. reviewing the work of another Koor employee - that is, internal quality assurance

For any consulting work that does not fit into one of the above categories, simply add a comment to the appropriate row in the tracking spreadsheet. The Engagement Manager and Head of Sales will decide whether to include such activity.
