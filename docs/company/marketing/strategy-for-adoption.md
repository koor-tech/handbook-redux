2. The sign up process has to be smooth enough not to scare people off.
   1. Free trial registration ends with a clean thank-you page.
   2. Lacking some sort of account creation - perhaps we can get by for now without it. Would be nice for customers to see the status of their subscription, if nothing else. Also for setting privacy and communication preferences.
3. We have to provide clear instructions for how to use KSD.
   1. The same instructions apply whether some is doing a trial or using Pro.
   2. People may find the instructions and give it a try without registering first. If it doesn't go well, they will give up and may never come back.
