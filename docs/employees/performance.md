# Employee Performance

## Timely feedback

At Koor Technologies, Inc., performance feedback is a continuous process. We give feedback (especially negative) as soon as possible. Most feedback will happen during 1:1 meetings, if not sooner. We evaluate and update compensation decisions yearly, shortly after the anniversary of a team member's start date.

## Performance reviews

Starting in June 2023, we are beginning a team member review cycle to provide feedback on job performance and career growth. Some important context:

1. From June 1, team members will have at least one week (5 or more working days) to provide feedback to the manager for their co-workers.
    - Anyone may give feedback.
    - Both positive and negative feedback is welcome.
    - Feedback should be delivered to the manager of the person who the feedback is about.
2. By June 20 (or the nearest working day), managers finish writing performance reviews for their direct reports.
3. Managers discuss the reviews with their managers for awareness and feedback about the writing and message.
4. By the last working day in June, Managers deliver the reviews to their directs.
5. The CEO or CTO gathers feedback on the process and refines the handbook for following year.

### Review structure

Each performance review has three sections:

1. Major accomplishments - to reflect on completed goals
2. Peer feedback - a summary of anonymized observations, notable situations, and patterns worth considering
3. Manager reflection and look ahead - highlighting improvement areas and guidance for the future

### Quarterly performance check-up

Every quarter, team members and managers should conduct a quick performance check-up as part of a 1-1 conversation. These will take place in September, December, and March.

1. Write down any key accomplishements of the past quarter. (These can roll up into the next annual review.)
2. Discuss any course corrections.

## Managing underperformance

Managing and identifying underperformance can be one of the most difficult responsibilities of a manager, but it's also one of the most important. As a people leader, to be fair and transparent with the team member, you want to address underperformance in a timely and structured way.

Koor Technologies, Inc. will leverage GitLab's skill-based and will-based performance model to identify the root cause of the team members' underperformance and with that determine the suitable remediation plan. The remediation plan will differ based on the type of performance issue.

### Remediation for underperformance

Managers should address performance concerns early and not wait until the performance problems have become unrecoverable. Feedback should be given early, it should be specific and documented. Remediation options will vary based on the circumstances, but as a best practice managers should leverage one or more of these approaches:

1. Coaching - engage with the team member to help diagnose problem(s) and solution(s), perhaps with some outside guidance such as articles or courses. Requires written followup but not cc to peopleops.
2. Written warning - an explicit notice that performance is not meeting the company's needs, citing examples of problems and clarity on expectations moving forward. (manager must cc peopleops@koor.tech)
3. Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) - a formal plan documenting problems, expectations, and a timeline for resolution to avoid termination. (manager must cc peopleops@koor.tech).

With either a Written Warning or Performance Improvement Plan the team member will meet jointly with their manager and the CEO to review the concerns outlined, discuss remediation steps, share additional context, or request additional help or support.

#### Coaching

Coaching is the preferred option to deal with underperformance and is the first step in addressing performance issues.

Managers are expected to address performance concerns in a timely manner. Managers should address concerns verbally during one-on-one meetings or in impromptu private coaching sessions with the team member. These conversations should be documented by the manager and shared with the team member so to ensure the context is clearly "coaching related to underperformance" and not simply "feedback" that may be provided more regularly and informally. The written feedback also should ensure alignment on where improvements need to be made and by when, and give the team member an opportunity to request clarification or a conversation with peopleops or the CEO. The note should be brief (a few key bullet points or a paragraph), and should be sent via email to the team member within 24 hours of the verbal discussion.

The GitLab handbook coaching section has other useful tips, including an email template.

#### Written warning

A Written Warning is used to bring attention to new or ongoing deficiencies in conduct and/or performance issues. The intent is to define the seriousness of the situation to encourage immediate corrective action. On a zoom meeting, the manager will inform the team member that they will be receiving a written warning. The Warning will identify development areas/gaps, outline what success looks like, and specific action/deliverables and due dates. This letter must then be sent to the team member and to peopleops@koor.tech.

As noted above, after receipt of a Warning, the team member will have an opportunity to discuss jointly with their manager and CEO.

#### Performance improvement plan (PIP)

Many companies use a PIP for most involuntary offboarding, as documented support for releasing a team member. At Koor Technologies, Inc. we think that giving someone a plan while you intend to let them go is a bad experience for the team member, their manager, and the rest of the team.

A PIP at Koor Technologies, Inc. is not used to "check the box." A PIP is a genuine last chance to resolve underperformance. A manager should only offer a PIP if they believe that the team member can successfully complete it. The team member should also be committed to successfully completing the PIP and maintaining the level of performance arrived at through the PIP. A PIP will not be successful unless both the team member and the manager believes the team member can succeed.

For team members who truly lack the skill for the role or for those team members who lack the will to be successful, a PIP should not be offered. PIPs, as mentioned above, are for team members who with additional guidance, coaching, resources or tools have the ability to improve and sustain long-term performance.

As noted above, after receipt of a PIP, the team member will have an opportunity to discuss with their manager and CEO together.
