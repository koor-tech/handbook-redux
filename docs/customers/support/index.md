# Koor's Support Services

This section of the handbook describes how we take care of customers. Our business depends on helping our customers with issues related to Rook Ceph data storage. Our customers come to us to resolve their problems.

While we may not be able to solve every issue, we need to explore all available options, and communicate our recommendations clearly. We also need to manage expectations and keep customers informed of progress. Customer need to know we have not forgotten about them.

Our long-term business depends on encoding our expertise with Rook Ceph into our software offering. We can harvest lessons from our customer engagements and come up with software improvements that would eliviate such problems for all customers. Harvesting ideas takes conscious effort, creativity, and discipline.

Follow the processes defined in this guide, and provide excellent support to our customers.

## Operations

### Roles

We have a few roles that are specific to customer service activities. These are roles that anyone in any job position may assume. The same person may assume different roles with different customers. Also, someone may assume more than one role for the same customer. The key point is to make sure someone is handling the responsibilities of the roles as needed, and that assignments are clear.

**Engagement Manager**

- Koor employee responsible for coordinating with the customer.
- Leads regular status meetings with active customers.
- Keeps in touch with customers who have gone quiet.

**Storage Specialist**

- The Koor employee with technical expertise who works directly with the customer's technical people to assess and resolve issues.
- Handle all of the detailed work.
- Informs Engagement Manager of new issues and blockers where alternative action may be needed.

### Meetings

We have a few types of meetings with customers.

**Exploratory**

- We may meet with a prospective customer to understand their situation. We should ask any questions we need to about the situation, without diving into details or attempt to resolve any issues.
- This is also the prospect's opportunity to decide whether they want to work with us.
- The purpose of the meeting is for both sides to decide whether to move forward.

**Kickoff**

- Once a prospect become a customer by signing paperwork and perhaps making a payment, we will have a kick-off meeting where we get enough of the details to begin the work.

**Checkpoint**

- From time to time, we will meet with the customer's project leaders to discuss any progress, to outline remaining work, and to hear any concerns or feedback from their perspective.

**Working**

- Anytime technical people are in a meeting to work on the customer's data storage is considered a working meeting. Frankly, this does not need a special name, but it may be useful in conversation.

### Weekly Rhythm

Koor has a simple weekly routine for staying on top of customer engagements. The hard part is having the discipline to follow it.

**Key Outcomes**

- Make sure each active customer is getting attention.
- Make sure projects are not stuck.
  - If any are, figure out how to unblock.
- Keep an accurate record of consulting hours.

**Steps to Follow**

On Monday and Thursday of each week, Engagement Managers review the situation for each of their assigned customers.

1. Use Linear to check on progress by Storage Specialists. Make sure all activities are represented by Linear issues, and that the issues have notes about the latest findings. Update statuses as appropriate.
2. Communicate with the customer with the latest information. If we are waiting on them for something, send a gentle reminder.
3. Make sure the latest activity by our Storage Specialists is recorded in our [tracking spreadsheet](./tracking).

**Additional Points**

- If a holiday occurs on one of these days, do this on the following day.
- If an Engagement Manager is taking vacation, arrange for another Engagement Manager to cover.
- At least once per month, reach out to any customers without an active project. Say hello, and remind them that we are here to help.
