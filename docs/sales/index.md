# Sales

The only way Koor will stay in business is to generate enough revenue to cover our costs and fuel our growth. That's what sales is all about.

## Strategy

Our sales strategy is simple. Offer customers data storage using Ceph, plus whatever additional software helps us manage the service at desired scale. Each customer gets their own storage cluster(s), whether we use their infrastructure or provision cloud resources on their behalf. Then we take care of it for them.

## What We Sell

Our primary product offering is **Managed Ceph**. That includes anything to do with setting up and maintaining storage. The basic offering is to handle set-up and maintenance of Ceph clusters on behalf of our customers. We do this for a fixed, per month price, procured on an annual basis.

### Service levels

There are other service levels depending on the scale of the customer and how much help they need. Going bigger, we can do Managed Ceph at an **enterprise level**. That might include additional services that increase the price, and volume discounts that lower the overall price. We will scale up to match the needs of customers with lots of data storage (50+ nodes).

On the other end, we can do discrete **one-off services**. We might do a system assessment on an existing cluster and make recommendations. We might troubleshoot a performance issue and suggest a plan to improve. For these types of services, our price will be based on an hourly rate and estimate of the hours it will take.

This piecemeal work might be "off of the menu," so to speak, something we work out when the customer "just needs a little help." We would prefer an annual agreement, but might see this as a step toward a long-term engagement.

We will also do extra projects that go above and beyond. Examples of such projects and higher service levels include:

- 24/7 emergency response SLAs.
- Data migration where we set up and manage the move.
- Disaster recovery planning, practice drills, and actual recovery from data loss due to circumstances outside of normal Ceph operation
  - The normal problems, like disc failures, are handled under **Managed Ceph**. These problems should not be disastrous because we are doing preventative maintenance.
- Additional security and compliance work.
- Other requests as needed...

We would either charge extra for these types of projects or include them as part of an enterprise deal.

### Hosting considerations

When we provision infrastructure for the customer, we will either change the customer a monthly *usage* fee or make that part of the overall price. As long as Koor is not set up to lose money, either can work.

For instance, we are planning to offer a "starter cluster" for customers who want to try Ceph without having to go through the learning curve. That service may be offered as a free trial, leading to a subscription when the trial period is over. Since the cluster will be a fixed size, we can factor the cost into our pricing.

If a customer has a larger operation, we might want to use a usage fee to pass along the cost, on top of our standard rates for Managed Ceph.

## How Customers Buy

There are a couple of simple steps to become a Koor customer.

1. Agree to our [Terms of Use](https://about.koor.tech/terms-of-use). These are found on the website and are part of every contract.
2. Sign a contract for an annual subscription for the product or service we are offering.
   1. The contract may include a scope of work to account for any specific requests by the customer.
   2. The contract will specify the number of nodes being licensed or cared for by Koor. 
      - Nodes are a reasonable proxy of the scale of data storage, regardless of how much actual and usable storage is available.
      - Customers may have one or more clusters, each with 4 or more nodes. We have a 4-node minimum per cluster for production. Anything less is fine for non-production uses. Koor only charges for production systems.
3. Payment is typically due immediately with a net 30 grace period.
   1. We take payment via Stripe and Bill. We can also take direct deposit (ACH), which saves on fees.
   2. Other arrangements - such as an installment plan - are possible, especially for larger scale operations. Details should be discussed when the contract is executed.

Once we have a signed contract, work will begin. If payment is not made by the due date, work may be suspended until that is sorted out.

We have a contract template in our private, shared folder on a Google drive. Ask Dave if you need access.
