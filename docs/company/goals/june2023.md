# June 2023

These are the goals Dave set for June, along with commentary regarding how we did.

## GROWTH: Get 30 KSD trial and 5 KSD Pro registrations

0% and 0% attainment of these goals in June

1. Revamp website messaging to target DIY, our current customer base
   * done - has not seemed to move any needles
2. Add knowledge center to website: blog, use cases, how-to videos, Koor documentation
   * done - ongoing effort, no videos yet, taking shape as a useful resource
3. Post a demo video showing the benefits of KSD, setting up one of the use cases
   * done - was not able to do this; lack of a demo environment => project to set up demo environment
4. See the [strategy for adoption](../marketing/strategy-for-adoption)
   * 50% - still could use better sign-up, account creation to make people feel welcome, like we are legit; also KSD lacking sufficient value to be worth trying


## TECHNOLOGY: 

1. Add 5 improvements to KSD
   * 0 - did not make any noteworthy improvements
2. Make 15 technical contributions to Rook and Ceph
   * 12 - collective contributions pretty close to goal; more due to good guessing
3. Outline use cases (for block, object, and file storage) and explain possible configuration for each
   * 0% - although this pushed us toward the goal; added some good descriptions of storage types


## TEAM: Establish a baseline for teammates

1. Complete first employee performance reviews
   * 100% - good level-set for everyone
2. Outline dev & support operations in Koor handbook
   * 100% - room for improvement, better collaboration and adoption
