# Keeping in touch

Koor's practice is to stay in touch with active customers. An active customer is one who has a current KSD Pro subscription or to whom we have sold consulting services within the past 12 months.

We should touch base with each customer on a monthly basis. It is a good practice to share whatever is new in KSD or with Rook and Ceph to help keep customers informed. We will write a common script (words to cut and paste in to email or Slack) to share news consistently and make sure we have a different message each month.

## How to engage customers

*IDEA: Let's have a system where every Koor team member is assigned a few customers to contact. 

1. Use a spreadsheet to track customers and who is the contact that month.
2. For the content of the message:
   1. Start with a personal sentence or two written in the team member's own words.
   2. Include the common messaging using cut-and-paste.
   3. Close with a personal salutation and offer to meet.
   4. Track the response in the spreadsheet. Share the response with the Engagement Manager, and cc the team.
3. Change assignments each month so that customers hear from a different team member.

Here are some examples of questions to ask in order to stay in touch:

1. How is your system performing?
2. Have you had any problems with your system lately?
3. *TODO - add more questions*

Offer to meet with customers if there is anything they would rather discuss than write in email.
