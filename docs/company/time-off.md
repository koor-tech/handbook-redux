# Time Off

Time off regulations are country specific. If there is a conflict between these guidelines and local regulations, local regulations of an employee take precedence.

In general, Koor Technologies, Inc, offers flexible time off. Employees are encouraged to take all holidays (as explained below), plus addition days off for personal reasons. All full-time employees get paid time off that resets each year.

As a guideline, 10 days of PTO per year is a reasonable baseline. It is normal to add an additional 5 days of PTO per year for each year of service to the company. It is common to cap PTO at 20 days, regardless of tenure.

Always discuss your time off plans with your manager. Be sure to record your requests formally in Deel. Also, post announcements of your days off to #people-ops on Slack to inform the team.

# Company Holidays

Koor is an international company with people from many different countries and backgrounds. Our company holiday policy reflects this reality.

The one common set of days off is centered on the Christmas and New Year's holidays, for a total of 4 weekday holidays. In addition, individual should follow their own national and religious holidays. The guideline is to take 10 days off in total per year for such official paid holidays. That means 6 holidays are at the employee's discretion for this purpose. Please coordinate with your manager.

Holidays do not accumulate. Take time off as they happen. If you end up working during a holiday (for instance, if you have to help resolve a customer emergency), you should make-up the missed time off as soon as feasible. Your manager will help to accomodate your situation.
