## Framing

Koor serves those who are inclined to handle their own data storage. Koor strives to simplify the operation of Rook and Ceph, adding tools and enhancements to the open source solutions.

As a company, Koor is five team mates strong. We need to earn the right to grow by proving the value of Koor.

## Stages

We can identify stages we need to get through to realize the company vision.

### 1. Establish KSD as a viable product

Customers need to see obvious value in spending their time and money to deploy KSD to manage their data storage. In this stage, the Koor team is focused on adding value to Ceph and Rook open source projects, as well as expanding the proprietary capabilities of KSD.

The Koor team also needs to help customers and prospects understand what KSD can do for them. A prospect who visits the Koor website should want to register to give KSD a try. Some of these prospects will need help with their existing Rook / Ceph implementation. We can sell them a Pro subscription, which comes with a system assessment. We can help with additional consulting as needed.

The experience with customers will show us gaps that we can address via enhancements to KSD. We will prioritize these improvements, turning KSD into an obvious must-have tool for managing data storage.

The primary goals of this stage are:

1. to convert every Rook user to a KSD user, and 
2. to grow the usage of KSD/Rook overall by attracting anyone who is thinking about data storage for the first time or regrouping from an unsuccessful outsourcing experience.

### 2. Empower data storage professionals

This stage is about growth via enterprise sales of KSD Enterprise. Larger organizations tend to have their own data storage teams, or at least members of an IT team who specialize in data management. We want to empower those teams to act as a service provider to their internal users, other departments in their organization. The better KSD Enterprise works for them, the better job security they will have.

The goal is for KSD Enterprise to become the defacto tool for do-it-yourself data teams.

### 3. Unleash Koor's DaaS offering

This stage is about Koor offering a Data-as-a-Service solution using KSD Enterprise to empower Koor's service team. Let's call it Koor DaaS for now. For Koor DaaS to be competitive with the big players (Akamai, AWS, et al), it has to handle security (including authorization and encryption), auto-scaling, replication, disaster recovery, and stringent SLAs.

There's a lot to get right, so it makes sense for this to be in a later stage of growth, once KSD Enterprise works and we have the resources to scale the team further.

### 4. World domination (at least of the data storage arena)

Of course, this is the ultimate destination, until the eventual collapse and ruin of the empire, as all things go.
