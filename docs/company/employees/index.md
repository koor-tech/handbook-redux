# Koor Techies

## Who We Are

We are a small team of aspiring data storage experts. We work together to solve customer problems and create software that makes it easier to manage self-hosted data storage. 

We are a remote team where each member is in a completely different location, spanning 3 continents and 5 countries. Our meetings are clustered during the 3 hours of overlap, which is only achieved by some teammate working later in their day. For this reason, asynchronous work is essential.

Of all the names we tried, Koor Techies seems to sum things up. We are open to other ideas.

## Watercooler

One of our standing meetings is the watercooler. This is primarily a social meeting, designed to help us learn more about each other and to stay in touch with what's going on in life. Unlike a physical watercooler where people meet more-or-less by accident, our watercooler is an intentional opportunity to socialize.

While it is okay to discuss work, it is better for this to be more of a fun connection point. Schedule separate meetings for serious work discussions. (Otherwise, no one will want to join the watercooler.)

## Announcing time off

Once you know you will take time off, make an annoucement in the people-ops channel to let the team know. For extended vacation (personal time off), let your manager know before announcing in case any adjustments to your plans are needed.
