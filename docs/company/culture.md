## Life at Koor


## Handbook

Koor is a fully remote company. That has a lot of advantages. To name one, we can bring the best talent the world has to offer wherever talented people have access to the Internet. For another, we save a lot of time we would otherwise waste commuting to and from an office.

A cornerstone that allows remote work to be effective is a handbook that is the single-source-of-truth for how we operate. You are reading the handbook now. If we have done a thorough and careful job, many questions are answered in these pages, saving people time in not having to repeat ourselves as new people come into the company, or we engage in a particular process for the first time, or we have to remember how to do that thing we don't do very often.

If you need further convincing that maintaining and depending on a common handbook is vital to running a remote company, [read this](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/handbook-first-documentation).

### What goes in the handbook

The handbook is meant to include just about everything we do and how we do it. It may be easier to define what belongs here by listing what does not belong here. If something is not in the following list, perhaps the handbook is the best place for it.

**Things to put elsewhere**

- Technical documentation:
  - Docs that explain how to use software (dev guide, API specs, etc.) we build should live in the software's source [repository](https://github.com/koor-tech).
  - All other technical information and knowledge sharing goes in our [Knowledge Center](https://kb.koor.tech/). 
  - Design artifacts for released software belong in the Knowledge Center or source repo. Choose one and cross link from the other.
  - Project work is tracked in Linear.
- Company Secrets
  - We do have a few secrets, although the line between private and public information may be more lenient than you expect.
  - Any related to system access - passwords, recovery keys, account numbers, and so on - should be stored in 1Password.
  - We also have a private handbook. Ask if you think you need to see it.
- Customer information
  - We never want to share or leak private information about our customers, primarily for their privacy, which is reason enough.
- Personnel information
  - We also do not want to expose sensitive employee information. That belongs in our HR systems only.


### How to add content

This handbook is written primarily in markdown, which makes it easy for anyone to contribute. The pages are built into a static website by the VitePress framework. We can extend the framework as needed using VueJS, the JavaScript framework that VitePress is built on.

If you are on the less technical side of things, never mind any of that. Just write the content in a Linear issue, and buddy up with someone who can help get it into the mix.
