# Sales

The only way Koor will stay in business is to generate enough revenue to cover our costs and fuel our growth. That's what sales is all about.

Our sales strategy is simple. Offer customers data storage using Ceph plus whatever additional software helps us manage the service at scale. Each customer gets their own storage cluster, and we take care of it for them.

More to come...
