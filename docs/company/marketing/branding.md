# Koor Branding

This handbook page includes information about Koor's branding, including guidelines on using our name and logo externally.

## Do we brand our product?

Yes, we want the world to think of Koor as "Rook Ceph Experts" and Koor products and services as "Rook for Professionals." Eventually, we want Koor to mean "Rook for the Enterprise."

We include a "Powered by Koor Technologies, Inc." tag in the Koor Storage Distribution. At this stage, we want people to think of Koor as a source of expertise with running Rook Ceph.

A major thrust of our brand is that we are part of the community that builds open source software that benefits society. The space in which we operate is already quite complicated, so we do not want to add more concepts to the mix. Rather, we will focus on the do-it-yourself (DIY) leanings of customers.

Koor's brand is about helping DIY storage professionals with the complexities of running Rook Ceph in Kubernetes. Koor is here with tools and expertise to make Rook Ceph easier to set up and maintain with confidence. Our typical consulting services are brief engagements limited to storage concerns. Over time, we will infuse our software products with that same level of expertise.

We want our product to be an essential element for anyone running Rook Ceph, well worth its marginal cost.

## Name

The name of our company is 'Koor Technologies, Inc.'. We use 'Koor' or 'Koor.Tech' as a shortcut - but be careful to use this only when in a context where it is clear that you are referring to Koor Technologies, Inc.

Incorrect usage:

- "Koor Technologies" X
- "Koortechnologies inc" X
- "koor" X

Correct Usage:

- Koor Technologies, Inc. (TM) ✓
- Koor Technologies, Inc. ✓
- Koor.Tech ✓
- Koor (TM) ✓

### Trademark

We are not able to register our trademark at this time. The US Patent and Trade Office denied our request to register Koor. That is not a problem, per se. We can still take measures to establish and protect our brand.

One measure is to use TM wherever we use Koor publicly. That means we should update our logos and the copy on our public websites and presentations (pitch decks, etc.). We should do the same in our legal documents.

We can make these changes opportunistically throughout the rest of the year, with a target to update the most visible usages first (by the end of July 2023).

## Branding assets

### Company letterhead

Our company Letterhead can be accessed [here](#TODO). This is read-only; make a copy to edit

### Company slides

Our company slides should be based on a [standard template](#TODO).

### Color Palette

Use primary and secondary as the base or main set of colors. Apply the accent color sparingly for calling attention to important things or to offer a visual break from "too much green." Use dark instead of black and light instead of white for backgrounds, etc.

The palette was enhanced by [Colormind](http://colormind.io/bootstrap/#).

```css
$primary: #19dda5; // "java" a.k.a. "Medium Aquamarine"
$secondary: #119671; // "jungle green" a.k.a. "Paolo Veronese Green"
$accent: #9e809a; // "mountbatten pink"
$light: #f6f5f6; // "wild sand"
$dark: #1d2628; // "shark" a.k.a. "Charleston Green"
```

### Logos

We use the following logos at Koor Technologies, Inc. When using the logos, please keep space between the logo and other images or text. Generally a good amount of separation space is the size of the Koor Technologies, Inc. 'K' away from the logo

## Sprint Updates

::: info
    This is a good idea that Koor has not implemented yet.
    Keep this here for when we start.
:::

At the end of each sprint, C-Level posts an update to a variety of social media channels. Here is the process:

1. Videos from each teammate are complete by AM on the Wednesday of the sprint end. See demo process for details on this.
2. Confirm that all videos are compiled in a YouTube playlist titled Progress Updates YYYY-MM-DD
3. Add C-Level video as first video in playlist; reorder the others roughly with the most important / informative updates nearest the top
4. Post the video and 1-2 highlights to Twitter from the [@koor_tech](https://twitter.com/koor_tech) account. Add \# and #remotework hashtags.
5. C-Level retweets from his personal account and \[EA:\] using Hootsuite (in the future), schedules the same post in our other media channels: including LinkedIn: Koor Technologies, Inc., and Twitter: Koor Technoliges, Inc..
