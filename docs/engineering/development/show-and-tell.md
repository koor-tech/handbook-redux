# Progress Reviews

## Purpose

We are a fully remote company, and software development is primarily a mental exercise. These factors lead us toward working alone. Proactively sharing what we have been working on is one way to bring us together. Through a ritual called "Show and Tell," we explain to each other recent accomplished and our creative work in progress. This activity is useful for a few reasons.

1. It forces us to organize our thoughts and explain our logic and reasons to someone else. Sometime this has a side effect of helping us realize where our designs or choices have gaps.
2. It helps others understand newer parts of the system and the choices that were made while building them.
3. It is an opportunity for everyone to learn and to share ideas, making us a stronger team.
4. It is a forcing function to complete the bit of work.
5. In the case where you are stuck, you will need to explain what you have done and what the problems are to get advice about what to try next.

Show and tell is primarily for an internal audience of co-workers. Sometimes we end up with a recording worth sharing on YouTube. That is secondary to the purpose of staying in touch with what each of us is doing.

## Guidelines

Demonstrating your work is a skill that takes practice to hone. Take the time to do this every week, and you will improve quickly.

While you are learning, follow a simple format:

1. **Short overview**: Say what you are going to present in 1 or 2 sentences.
2. **Show the goal**: If the code is working, start by showing the functionality in action. If it is not working yet, explain what you are trying to get it to do.
3. **Explain the architecture or design**:
   1. What are the parts?
   2. Are components organized into layers?
   3. How are they meant to work together?
4. **Show code / how it works**:
   1. Choose two or three interesting samples of code
   2. Make sure your font is big enough for people to see.
5. **Take questions**: Think about pausing every 5 minutes or between topics to see if there are questions.

Highlight or deep-dive at least one major effort of the past week. You can also show a few different things if they are smaller and quick to explain.

Take the time to review other people's summaries. Participate to the best of your ability, even if that is mostly to watch / read, ask questions, and learn. Contribute feedback and questions if you are able.

Present during the show-and-tell meeting or share asynchronously in writing or by recording a video. You can even share before the meeting and use the meeting time to answer questions and hear feedback.

<Badge type="warning" text="ToDo" /> Let's figure out a good way to share asynchronous show-and-tell updates. Need a way to exchange comments, keep an archive.

### What to show

Choose something that would be of interest to others. It could be:

* a design
* a bug - before and after the fix
* an entire new feature
* an improvement to a feature (e.g., better UX) or the code (e.g., refactoring)
* a set of automated tests

Limit the scope by focusing on what was done recently. Choose an area that:

* you want to show off, 
* made you learn something, 
* you are having problems with, 
* you have questions about, 
* others should know about, 
* might benefit from other opinions.
