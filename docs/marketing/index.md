# Koor Marketing

## Positioning

Koor is a champion of open source. We are one of the maintainers of the [Rook](https://rook.io) open source project. Rook brings [Ceph](https://ceph.io), an open source data storage solution, to Kubernetes clusters.

Koor offer tools for the do-it-yourself data storage professional (and enthusiastic hobbyists). The Koor Storage Distribution (KSD) is this bundle of tools, including a fork of the Rook project, the Koor Operator, a Rook / Ceph version service to know when updates are available, and troubleshooting tools.

The Koor team is actively building enhancements and new features for KSD. The most anticipated feature is the Koor Dashboard, coming soon.

If you are using Rook Ceph for data storage, you need to license the KSD to make your work easier.
