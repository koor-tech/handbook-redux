# Keeping in touch

Koor's practice is to stay in touch with active customers. An active customer is one with a current Pro subscription or to whom we have sold consulting services within the past 12 months.

## How to engage customers

Each customer will have a Koor Engagement Manager. The Engagement Manager might also be the Storage Specialist. These roles are hats that we wear.

When reaching out to keep in touch, keep a few points in mind.

1. Understand the terms of our engagement with the customer. Be mindful of any specific arrangements.
2. Share something useful, some information or news about Koor, or ways we can help them.
   1. We can coordinate on these points for consistency.
3. Offer to meet, and provide a link to your Calendly so that they can schedule.
4. Track responses in our [tracking spreadsheet](./tracking).
