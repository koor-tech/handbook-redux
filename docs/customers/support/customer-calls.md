# Customer Calls

The obvious first, be respectful, nice and confident in your communications. 

Try to reiterate points brought up by the customer to make sure that everyone is on the same page.

Should a customer have any questions that you can't answer on the spot, make sure to write them down and add them to the customer ticket as a ticket so it can be tracked.
Same goes for topics a customer might have questions about, document them in a ticket so that they don't fall under the rug and get forgotten.

## Discovery Call

We use a simple "discovery call checklist" in form of a Google form here: [Koor Customer Discovery Checklist](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1uModm46mQkSSWV84CNNL-_m5nnsX9yo58xkwxb--SYQ/edit?usp=forms_home&ths=true).

The checlist should cover the most important points from our side to make sure we move forward with customer into the right direction.

### "What is the right direction?"

* If a customer has a critical issue causing a production outage (aka "costing them money"), we obviously need to move fast to get them running again.
* Is the customer looking for a more managed approach to storage in containers? Introducing them to the Koor Storage Distribution would be an idea.
