## Handbook

Koor is a fully remote company. That has a lot of advantages. To name one, we can bring the best talent the world has to offer wherever talented people have access to the Internet. For another, we save a lot of time we would otherwise waste commuting to and from an office.

A cornerstone that allows remote work to be effective is a handbook that is the single-source-of-truth for how we operate. You are reading the handbook now. If we have done a thorough and careful job, many questions are answered in these pages, saving people time in not having to repeat ourselves as new people come into the company, or we engage in a particular process for the first time, or we have to remember how to do that thing we don't do very often.

If you need further convincing that maintaining and depending on a common handbook is vital to running a remote company, [read this](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/handbook-first-documentation).

### How to add content

This handbook is written primarily in markdown, which makes it easy for anyone to contribute. The pages are built into a static website by the VitePress framework. We can extend the framework as needed using VueJS, the JavaScript framework that VitePress is built on.

If you are on the less technical side of things, never mind any of that. Just write the content in a Linear issue, and buddy up with someone who can help get it into the mix.
