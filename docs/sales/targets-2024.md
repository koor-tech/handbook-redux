title: Sales Target from 2024

# 2024 Sales Targets

Our sales targets flow from our [company goals](../company/goals/annual2024).

> **Grow annual revenue to $1MM**
> **Aquire 100 new customers, including 10 enterprise customers**

The first target is about the amount of revenue we generate.

The second is about the diversity of customers we want in order to have a healthy balance of interests. We prefer to have a variety of customers in different industries and data usage profiles.

If we achieve the revenue goal with only a few large customers, that would be acceptable. If we close that many customers, we are likely to surpass the revenue goal, too, as long as our pricing structure holds up. Discounts for enterprise customers (i.e., those with 50+ nodes) are built into the revenue model.

The point of reaching these numbers is survival. We need to have enough business to prove our value in the marketplace and to raise funds for rapid company growth.

## Q1 Targets

We will revisit and adjust these targets on a quarterly basis.

For the first quarter of 2024, our targets are chosen to help sustain our business and to begin to find momentum in the market.

1. Sell $100,000 in Managed Ceph
2. Acquire 1 enterprise-scale customer (50+ nodes)

Ideally, we will close a few smaller-scale customers in addition to the one enterprise scale customer.

## Q2 Targets

1. Sell $200,000 in Managed Ceph
2. Acquire 1 enterprise-scale customer (50+ nodes)

This would be a healthy ramp and buy us more time to close funding.

## Q3 Target

1. Sell $300,000 in Managed Ceph
2. Acquire 3 enterprise-scale customers

Continue to ramp toward annual goals.

## Q4 Target

1. Sell $400,000 in Managed Ceph
2. Acquire 5 enterprise-scale customers

Growth to close the year and launch into 2025.
