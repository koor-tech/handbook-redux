# Communication

## General guidelines

We are a fully remote company. That means we make heavy use of collaboration tools: Slack, Google Meet, Zoom, Linear (for project management), Status Hero for daily individual progress updates, and email, etc.

Since we each work at hours that make sense for our location on the globe, we need to make an extra effort to communicate. This can work to our advantage, since the extra care in communicating means we will write down more information. We have longer cycles to think and confirm our understanding of any given topic.

What we miss are the visual cues. Is the other person paying attention? Are they confused by something we said? Are they in agreement, or do they want to make a counterpoint?

What is the same is that people always misunderstand each other. We all bring different perspectives and experience that leads to how we perceive what is said.

We will not solve all communication problems with some points in a handbook. However, we can try to operate in a way that makes good communication more likely. The number one guideline over all others is:

::: tip
Assume good intentions.
:::

This opens the way for patience and courtesy. If there is contention, you can first seek understanding. Once you see the disconnect, you can discuss reasons and alternatives.

The quickest way to closed communications is to assume the other person is an idiot.

## Levels of confidentiality

Consider the audience for your message.

- Public
  - Any message meant for the outside world. Public communication includes anything on our website, in email signatures, in recordings that are shared openly. If anyone might be able to see it, it is public.
- Internal
  - A lot of our communication will fall into this category. Consider project work, planning, company status, general customer activities and other such topics. We may choose to make such communication public (such as this handboook, or an internal progress demo), but not by default.
- Customer
  - Interactions with customers need to be treated with confidentiality and privacy in mind.
- Employee
  - When discussing matters related to employment that are private in nature.
- Priviledged
  - Information that may only be shared with specific individuals for legal or competitive reasons.

## Internal communication

- Favor Slack over email for internal communications.

## Meetings

Although related to communication, this might need it's own page. Someday...

### Progress Reviews

1 hour; weekly

Everyone shares an important project they are working on, showing progress in the past week or since last discussed.

### Planning

30 minutes; weekly

We review each project, update statuses of items to match the current state, and settle assignments for the new cycle. Longer planning discussions and project collaboration happen outside of this meeting.

### Water Cooler

15 minutes, 3 times per day M - Th, once on Fridays

For casual discussions, a few chances each day to get to know colleagues better.

### Retrospectives

1 hour; monthly

Everyone has a chance to share what is working, what is not working, and ideas to try.

## Using Slack, StatusHero, email, video conferencing (Zoom / Meet / Jitsi)

### Slack

Slack is our tool for "immediate" communication. In our case, timing is relative to our working hours, so an "immediate" response might happen within a day, longer if a weekend is involved.

From another perspective, while Slack retains messages for a while, they start to fade after a couple of days. If you do not get the response you hoped for, you will have to post a reminder to your thread.

Speaking of threads, try to hold longer discussions in a thread.

::: tip
As a point of etiquette, acknowledge messages in Slack by replying or with an emoji, especially when you are `@mentioned`.
:::

The medium is designed for multi-way communication, and being remote means we are limited in ways to interact.

Slack is not the place for long-lived documentation. Communication that is more permanent belongs in this handbook, a Google doc, a README file in a code repo, a PR, or another place for artifacts.

### Status Hero

We use StatusHero to keep a daily record of what everyone is doing. The tool encourages a good habit of reflecting daily about your priorities. If you accomplished something, you can give yourself a gold star. If you got distracted or planned to much, use that observation while planning your next steps. By writing down and sharing these thought in StatusHero, we can cheer each other on.

Ten minutes of reflection each day raises our consciousness. Being conscious of our choices allows us to work with purpose. Time will pass regardless, so let's make the most of it.

The tool is only useful when we use it every working day. Here are some guidelines:

- Use Status Hero every day.
  - A brief summary about "yesterday" and "today" is sufficient.
  - Be honest with yourself about what you did not finish or forgot about completely.
- Missing a day or two each week from time to time is forgiveable.
  - Missing too often leaves a hole in awareness, leading to doubt about what you are doing.
  - This is one data point. Maybe your activity speaks for itself. There should be plenty of other evidence that you making progress. Why not mention it?
- Be informative. We are sharing so others can understand each other's context.
  - Something like "Worked on the project" is too vague. Make it more like "Added screen for picking a color scheme."
  - Do not write to impress others (i.e., your manager). Treat it more as a journal entry for yourself (that others will see).
  - Fake news is discouraged.

### Email

- Email may be the best way to communicate with a group that spans multiple companies.
- Favor Slack over email for internal communications.

### Video Conferencing

- Having cameras on is best.
- Without physical cues, it can be hard to know when to stop talking. Interruptions are expected. You can use your polite words, then make your points.
- Be part of the discussion. Express your views and ideas without waiting for a better time, which may never come.
  - Volunteer to be a note taker. Help push the agenda along.
- When sharing your screen, if you are sharing code, make sure the font is big enough for others to see.
  - Otherwise, you are not really sharing. You might as well wave your hands around.
- Give the meeting your attention.
  - No coding, no closing little tasks, no reading articles.
