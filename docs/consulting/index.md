# Koor's Support Services

In the beginning, Koor offered consulting as a way to attract customers and to provide opportunities to learn about customer needs. Whatever we can learn by helping customers is likely to be useful when coming up with great product that address underlying issues.

However, Koor needs to be a product company in order to have the economics that will allow rapid growth. We need to be able to leverage the value of a great product line that generates healthy margins so that we can reinvest into making better software that solves more problems.

Whatever the long-term motivation, serving customers well is the only path to sustained growth. While we talk about consulting, the overarching goal is for customers to feel supported by Koor. That could be through a helpful answer to a question, fulfilling a commitment to provide regular service, or standing by a customer in a time of need when their systems are in disarray.

This section of the handbook describes how we take care of customers.

## Operations

Koor has a weekly routine for staying on top of customer engagement. 

*TODO Let's decide on the right actions to take on a weekly basis. What you see below is a starting point that needs improvement.*

1. At the start of each week:
   1. The Engagement Manager reviews each consulting engagement and asks questions to understand how things are going and what is left to do.
   2. Team members reflect on their consulting work from the previous week and updates a to-do list for the current week.
   3. Any new customers (KDS Pro subscribers) must be contacted to schedule a discovery call. The Engagement Manager assigns an Engagement Lead for each new customer.
   4. Review the [tracking spreadsheet](tracking) to ensure that hours for the previous week are accurately noted.
2. At the end of each week:
   1. Each team member updates the [tracking spreadsheet](tracking) to record hours spent on consulting. Remember to record "non-billable" hours as well.
   2. Write a summary of next steps for each active engagement.
