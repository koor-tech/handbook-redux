# Release Checklist

## General Procedure

For each release, copy the steps from [the template](https://linear.app/koorinc/document/release-checklist-b1af1d958c94) attached to the "Productization" project in Linear into a new Linear issue. Check off tasks as you finish them. Use sub-tasks if needed - or just put a name on each line of the checklist.

If you notice a step that is not listed, add it to the checklist. Also, add it to the template in Linear, or at least create a separate issue to add the step to the template later.

## Checklist Structure

This is the high-level structure of the release process. The [template in Linear](https://linear.app/koorinc/document/release-checklist-b1af1d958c94) is the official checklist that includes all of the details.

- Sync with the latest upstream Rook release
- Build the latest versions of our sub-systems
- Write release notes
- Test the release
- Distribute release
- Announce the release
