# Employee On-boarding

Follow this checklist so that new joiners have a reasonably smooth experience getting started. Most items should be completed on the person's start date or later. It will take some back-and-forth with the employee to get everything set up.

# Before Start Date

## Inform the Team

- Make an announcement on the #announcements Slack channel
  - Name, role, start date

## Purchase Equipment

- Order a computer, delivered to the employee's home office
  - Give the employee a budget (e.g., $3,500 US) and freedom to choose something appropriate for their type of work.

## Make sure employment paperwork is complete

- The recruiter may have primary responsiblity for this. Doesn't hurt to double-check and help if the joiner needs a nudge to finish or has questions.

# On or After Start Date

## Set up Accounts

- G-Suite
  - create email account: first_name @ koor.tech
    - keep password safe - have employee change it immediately
  - add to groups
    - Employees
- 1Password
  - Add as team member
- Slack
- Linear
- GitHub
- Zoom
- Calendly, for anyone who might meet with customers or conduct interviews

## Invite to Meetings

- Weekly meetings
  - Progress review and planning
  - Watercoolers
  - 1-1 with manager

## Other Considerations

- Company credit card - only if needed
